	  Version 2 of the SSMSTORE allows secure communication with the SMM
	  and makes no asumptions of the data structure stored in the store.
	  It splits the store into chunks to allows fault tolerant writes.

	  Sets the size of the default SMMSTORE FMAP region.
	  If using an UEFI payload, note that UEFI specifies at least 64K.
	  The current implementation of SMMSTORE is append only, so until
	  garbage collection is implemented it is better to set this to
	  a rather large value.
